### [Traffic Light](https://github.com/shashwatpatel/Embedded-Systems/tree/main/Traffic%20Light%20Controller)
- Implement a traffic light controller with directions South and West and implement a pedestrian walk for each direction such that the pedestrians can cross the street without getting hit my any vehicles

### [Position Meter System Using the ADC and the LCD](https://github.com/shashwatpatel/Embedded-Systems/tree/main/Position%20Meter%20System%20Using%20the%20ADC%20and%20LCD)
- Interface a 16x2 LCD using a Blind Cycle Transfer synchronization and create a device driver that will facilitate the usage of I/O ports. Additionally, design a position meter that will use a 14-bit ADC built into the microcontroller that converts position into resistance

### [Serial Communication and the Seven Segment Display](https://github.com/shashwatpatel/Embedded-Systems/tree/main/Serial%20Communication%20and%20the%20Seven%20Segment%20Display)
- Develop a device driver for the seven-segment display. Also, create an interruput handler that when external switches connected to the ports are pressed. Additionally, add a SysTick functionality to Deboubnce the swithces. Then, add an 8-bit shift register that will extend the driver to display a 4-digit seven segment display
